# Faisal's Starter Code Flutter

> Version 1.0.0

This repository contains my starter code for a Flutter project, which is highly inspired by [dbestech](https://dbestech.com) and [Very Good Ventures](https://verygood.ventures).

For quick installation, you can run the following command:

**Linux & MacOS:**

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fzl-22/faisal-starter-code-flutter/master/install.sh > install.sh && bash install.sh
```

> Note: `gnu-sed` is required for installation on MacOS (`brew install gnu-sed`)

## 3. Directory Structures and Architectural Overviews

### 3.1 `assets/`

This directory contains asset resources such as fonts, images, icon, and etc. Any new asset must be registered to [pubspec.yaml](./pubspec.yaml) and [lib/core/resources](./lib/core/resources/).

### 3.2 `lib/`

Here resides the application source code. Contains only [lib/core/] and [lib/src/].

#### 3.2.1 `lib/core/`

Contains core features and utilities of the app written **mostly** in Dart code (_almost framework-independent_).

##### 3.2.1.1 `lib/core/common/`

Contains application-wide shared themes, widgets, screens, or state.

##### 3.2.1.2 `lib/core/constants/`

Contains application-wide constant values.

##### 3.2.1.3 `lib/core/errors/`

Contains predefined exceptions and failures.

##### 3.2.1.4 `lib/core/extensions/`

Contains developer-defined extensions for built-in Dart object. This directory provides more-compact of some Dart object/method calls.

##### 3.2.1.5 `lib/core/injection/`

Contains injection of dependencies of the application architecture. This directory provides dependency injection container.

##### 3.2.1.6 `lib/core/resources/`

Contains registered constants that hold the value of each assets path in [assets/](./assets/) and defined typographies. This dependency provides UI assets consistency.

##### 3.2.1.7 `lib/core/router/`

Contains application routes and transitions. This directory defines routes configuration.

##### 3.2.1.8 `lib/core/usecase/`

Contains classes that encapsulate the business logic of the application (usecases).

##### 3.2.1.9 `lib/core/utils/`

Contains additional utilities to the application.

#### 3.2.2 `lib/src/`

This directory holds the features of the application. Any feature added in the application must reside in this directory as `lib/src/[feature]/`.

Each feature has 3 layers according to the Clean Architecture design by Robert C. Martin.

![](./assets/readme/clean-architecture-flow.jpg)
Source image: [dbestech.com](https://www.dbestech.com/)

So, each feature must have:

- `lib/src/[feature]/domain/`
- `lib/src/[feature]/data/`
- `lib/src/[feature]/presentation/`

##### 3.2.2.1 Domain Layer (`lib/src/[feature]/domain/`)

Domain layer contains the business logic of the application (core business logic, not BLoC logic).

> Domain does not depend on anyone. Presentation layer finds domain layer to work with.

This layer have 3 sublayers:

- `lib/src/[feature]/domain/entities/`
- `lib/src/[feature]/domain/repos/`
- `lib/src/[feature]/domain/usecases/`

###### 3.2.2.1.1 Entities (`lib/src/[feature]/domain/entities/`)

Entities hold the blue print of data model which we will pass around for a certain features or screens or pages.

###### 3.2.2.1.2 Repositories (`lib/src/[feature]/domain/repos`)

Domain repositories contains abstract classes that defines a contract between domain layer and data layer.

> The method of repository must be implemented in the data layer's repository.

###### 3.2.2.1.3 Usecases (`lib/src/[feature]/domain/usecases`)

Usecases contains communication tunnel between presentation and domain layer

> Usecases depend on repositories and should be independent of anything outside of domain layer.

##### 3.2.2.2 Data Layer (`lib/src/[feature]/data/`)

Data layer is an interface to communicate with data outside the app (remote or local).

> Data layer depends on domain layer.

This layer have 3 sublayers:

- `lib/src/[feature]/data/models/`
- `lib/src/[feature]/data/repos/`
- `lib/src/[feature]/data/datasources/`

###### 3.2.2.2.1 Models (`lib/src/[feature]/data/models/`)

Model is an extension of the _extensions_. This sublayer provides JSON serialization or constructorss to interact with outside data.

###### 3.2.2.2.2 Repositories (`lib/src/[feature]/data/repos/`)

The repos in data layer is the implementation of the repos in the domain layer. It provides the communication with domain layers.

> Data layer's repositories depends on datasources.

###### 3.2.2.2.3 Data Sources (`lib/src/[feature]/data/datasources/`)

Data sources provides communication with data from outside (API, local storage, and etc).

> Data sources depends on external source, for example: http package.

##### 3.2.2.3 Presentation Layer (`lib/src/[feature]/presentation/`)

Presentation layer provides UI presented to the user. Flutter's code only resides here in `lib/src/[feature]/` directory.

DO NOT add framework-dependent code to any other layer than the presentation layer.

> Presentation layer is framework-dependent and depends on domain layer.

This layer **may have** 3 sublayers:

- `lib/src/[feature]/domain/bloc/`
- `lib/src/[feature]/domain/views/`
- `lib/src/[feature]/domain/widgets/`

This sublayer can have `providers` to manages local state-abstraction if necessary.

###### 3.2.2.3.1 BLoC (`lib/src/[feature]/presentation/bloc`).

BLoC contains the state management to controls UI state.

> BLoC is dependent to the domain layer's usecases.

It provides multilayer state-management between presentation layer and domain layer.

**Note:** It is recommended to inject BLoC to the widget tree via the [router](./lib/core/router/) instead of the root widget or inside a views.

###### 3.2.2.3.2 Views (`lib/src/[feature]/presentation/views`).

Views sublayer provides the screens of the feature. The state of the screens and widgets inside is controlled with state manager.

###### 3.2.2.3.3 Widgets (`lib/src/[feature]/presentation/widgets/`).

Provides the feature-wide shared widgets that resides in the views sublayer.

## 5 Documentation

The documentation of this project can be generated using [dartdoc](https://pub.dev/packages/dartdoc).

Install compatible version of `dartdoc`.

```bash
fvm dart pub global activate dartdoc
```

In the project root directory, generate HTML documentation.

```bash
dart doc .
```

> Make sure you have no error in the source code

Your generated documentation will be on `doc/api/` directory.

Serve the docs with [dhttpd](https://pub.dev/packages/dhttpd) package (install with `fvm dart pub global activate dhttpd`).

```bash
dhttpd --path doc/api
